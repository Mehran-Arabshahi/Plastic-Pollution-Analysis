Significance of Plastic Waste 

Excess amounts of plastic waste is an ongoing issue regressing environments and ecosystems around the world. It threatens wildlife as many animals are dying from the consumption of plastic. In addition, the production generates GHG emissions that have direct correlation with climate change. This can clearly be seen in Asia where many of these countries contribute to high amounts of GreenHouse Gas emissions. Many civilians within these areas suffer from plastic pollution that is not maintained properly. Furthemore, this mishandle of waste causes polluted areas and inhalation of toxic chemicals within their bodies.

This project aims to address the ongoing issue of plastic waste seen within Asian Countries. The information was gathered from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#:~:text=The%20world%20produces%20around%20350,plastic%20enter%20the%20oceans%20annually) where it displays sectors of waste prominent to each area. The interactive dashboard was made possible through Python Code and MS Excel.
